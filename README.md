- **index.css**: The global CSS file for styling the application.

- **index.js**: The entry point of the application.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

- **db.json**: A JSON file that can be used for simulating a database or API responses.

- **package-lock.json**: Auto-generated file used for package management.

- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration for the Tailwind CSS framework.
